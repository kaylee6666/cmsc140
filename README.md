My project is a small game called "Coin Game". Besically, the user need to pick up the good coins from random good or bad coins generated. 
I wrote code to make little coins, use random generator to give random coins each time, and record the scores in the end.
It is very easy for user. When the program is running, the comments will tell user to press continue to start the game, and then they can just follow the rules shwon to play. 


Instructions for running the program: A simple way is copying the code directly and add to your editor and run it.
